- Developed a AI assistant to summarise audio
lectures/youtube videos and convert them into notes
using OpenAI's Whisper Library and Langchain.
- Utilised Langchain to allow users to interact with the
assistant with MCQ and test their learnings.
- PDF notes of the lecture will be automatically generated
by the bot.
- Integrated everything into one package using Django.
